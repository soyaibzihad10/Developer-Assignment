# ðŸš€ AffPilot Auth Service

A robust authentication and authorization service for managing user identities, issuing JWT tokens, and implementing role-based access controls.

> **DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENT**: This project serves as a technical assessment for backend engineers. Candidates should implement the authentication service according to the specifications below, with particular attention to the database schema and API endpoints.

## Overview

The Authentication Service provides:
- Secure user authentication (username/password)
- JWT token issuance
- Comprehensive identity and access management (IAM)
- Email verification workflow

## Features

### Authentication
- Username/password login
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management with JWT
- Email verification with time-limited hash links

### Authorization
- Role-based permissions system with four user types:
  - **System Admin**: Full system access (defined at initialization)
  - **Admin**: Full access except cannot modify other admins
  - **Moderator**: Can manage all data but cannot delete users
  - **User**: Can only manage their own data
- Permission-based access control

### User Management
- Create, read, update user accounts
- Role assignment (admin only)
- Email verification workflow
- User deletion request workflow

### Administration
- Initial system admin credentials defined in environment variables
- Protected admin functions
- Audit trail for role assignments
- Tiered administrative privileges

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

## Assignment Deliverables

Candidates should implement:

1. Database migrations for the schema defined above
2. User authentication system with JWT-based sessions
3. Email verification workflow with time-limited tokens (5-minute expiry)
4. Role-based authorization system with four user types:
   - System Admin
   - Admin
   - Moderator
   - User
5. System administrator initialization from environment variables
6. Account deletion request workflow
7. API endpoints with proper access control
8. Unit and integration tests
9. Documentation for any additional design decisions

## User Types and Permissions

### System Admin
- Created when the database is initialized (from environment variables)
- Has complete access to all system functions
- Cannot be deleted from the system
- Can promote users to any role
- Can demote any user except other System Admins
- Can manage all roles and permissions

### Admin
- Has full administrative access
- Cannot remove System Admins or other Admins
- Cannot promote users to System Admin role
- Can promote users to Moderator or Admin
- Can manage all roles and permissions

### Moderator
- Can create, read, update, and delete data
- Cannot delete user accounts directly
- Can process deletion requests from users
- Can manage content but not system configuration

### User
- Can only create, read, update, and delete their own data
- Cannot access other users' data
- Can request account deletion (to be processed by Moderator+)

## Email Verification Process

1. When a user registers, their account is created with `email_verified = false`
2. A verification token is generated and stored in the user record
3. The token expiry is set to 5 minutes from creation time
4. An email is sent to the user with a verification link containing the token
5. When the user clicks the link within 5 minutes:
   - The token is validated
   - The user's email is marked as verified
   - The token is cleared from the database
6. If the token has expired:
   - The user is prompted to request a new verification email
   - A new token is generated with a new 5-minute expiry

## Account Deletion Workflow

1. User requests account deletion via API
2. User record is flagged with `deletion_requested = true`
3. Moderator, Admin, or System Admin reviews the request
4. Upon approval, the user account is deleted from the system
